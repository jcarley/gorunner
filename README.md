gorunner
========

gorunner is an attempt to create a continuous integration web server written in golang.
As development occurs, I hope reusable code and interfaces develop since go is a
relatively new language.

Installation instructions
----

	$ cd $GOPATH/src
	$ go get github.com/jcarley/gorunner
	$ cd github.com/jcarley/gorunner
	$ go run main.go
	
Or, you know, whatever works. 

Screenshots
----

Jobs are the bucket of things, such as triggers and tasks, that tell the system
when to execute and what to do.

Tasks are editable in the browser.

When a job executes, it creates a run which records the output of the tasks.
